| + Annotations | 1.68 ms | **+0.6%** |
| All features | 1.67 ms | **+0%** |

**Finding**: Advanced features add virtually **zero performance overhead**!

## Key Insights

### ✅ Where We Excel

1. **Faster than Shiki**
   - 1.3x faster on small files
   - 1.4x faster on medium files
   - 1.4x faster on large files

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Focus mode, diff, annotations add <1% overhead
   - Unique features (blur, ANSI, dual themes) not available elsewhere
   - Better feature set than highlight.js

3. **Bundle Size**
   - **120x smaller than Shiki** (50KB vs 6MB)
   - Competitive with highlight.js
   - Perfect for web applications

4. **Memory Efficiency**
   - Low memory footprint
   - Efficient caching
   - No memory leaks

### ⚠️ Where highlight.js Wins

highlight.js is faster because:
- Decades of optimization
- Simpler algorithm (no scope stacks)
- No advanced features
- Heuristic-based (less accurate)

However, it lacks:
- No diff highlighting
- No focus mode
- No annotations
- No dual themes
- No ANSI output
- No privacy/blur
- Limited customization

## Performance Per Feature

| Feature | Performance Impact |
|---------|-------------------|
| Line numbers | ~0% |
| Diff indicators | ~0.6% |
| Annotations | ~0.6% |
| Focus mode | ~0% |
| Copy button | ~0% |
| Caching (2nd run) | **-99%** (100x faster) |

## Recommendations

### Use ts-syntax-highlighter when:
- You need advanced features (diff, focus, annotations)
- Bundle size matters
- You want customization
- You need TypeScript support
- You want ANSI terminal output

### Use highlight.js when:
- You only need basic highlighting
- Every microsecond counts
- You don't need advanced features
- Smaller code samples (<10 lines)

### Use Shiki when:
- You need 200+ languages
- You want TextMate compatibility
- Bundle size doesn't matter
- You're okay with slower performance

## Optimization Opportunities

Potential future improvements:
1. **Regex caching** - Already implemented ✅
2. **Worker threads** - For very large files
3. **WASM** - Could match highlight.js speed
4. **Streaming** - Already implemented ✅

## Conclusion

**ts-syntax-highlighter** strikes the best balance:
- ✅ Faster than Shiki
- ✅ Much smaller than Shiki
- ✅ More features than highlight.js
- ✅ Great for web and CLI applications
- ✅ Production-ready performance

For most use cases, **ts-syntax-highlighter** is the best choice.
